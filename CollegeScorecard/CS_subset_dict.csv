This metric does not apply during 2000-01, when degree/certificate-seeking status was not collected. It is calculated as the number of part-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates divided by the number of degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates. It includes non-first-time undergraduates. Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent."Average net price for Title IV institutions (public institutions),NPT4_PUB,,,IPEDS,"The average annual total cost of attendance (CostT4_A, CostT4_P), including tuition and fees, books and supplies, and living expenses, minus the average grant/scholarship aid. It is calculated for all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. It is included in the IPEDS Student Financial Aid component. Separate metrics are calculated for public institutions and private institutions. For academic-year institutions, net price represents an average of all programs and includes only undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term. For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment), net price represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution for the length of the full program, regardless of program length (see LProgram), and it includes undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year. For public institutions, this metric is limited to undergraduates who pay in-state tuition and receive Title IV aid. For private institutions, it includes all undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. The total cost of attendance depends on whether undergraduates live on campus, off campus (not with family), or off campus (with family)."Average net price for Title IV institutions (private for-profit and nonprofit institutions),NPT4_PRIV,,,IPEDS,Percentage of undergraduates who receive a Pell Grant,PCTPELL, ,,IPEDS,"The proportion of undergraduates who received a Pell grant in the academic year, calculated from the IPEDS Student Financial Aid component. This metric is calculated by IPEDS as the quotient of the number of Pell grant recipients divided by the count of all undergraduates for either a fall enrollment cohort (for institutions that primarily follow an academic year calendar system) or a full-year enrollment cohort (for institutions that primarily follow a continuous enrollment or program-based calendar system). Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent. This metric is not available prior to the 2008â€“09 academic year.""First-time, full-time student retention rate at four-year institutions",RET_FT4,,,IPEDS,"The proportion of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who were enrolled at the institution in the fall 1 year after starting at the institution, calculated from the IPEDS Fall Enrollment component. Separate metrics are calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. The retention rate is calculated as the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled in the fall term of the current academic year divided by the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled in the fall of the prior academic year. This metric is not available prior to the 2004â€“05 academic year.
